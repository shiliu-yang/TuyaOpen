## Overview
tuyaopen is an open source AI+IoT development framework that supports cross-chip platforms and operating systems. It is designed based on a universal southbound interface and supports communication protocols such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Ethernet. It provides core functionalities for AI+IoT development, including pairing, activation, control, and upgrading.
The sdk has robust security and compliance capabilities, including device authentication, data encryption, and communication encryption, meeting data compliance requirements in various countries and regions worldwide.

AI+IoT products developed using the tuyaopen, if utilizing the functionality of the tuya_cloud_service component, can make use of the powerful ecosystem provided by the Tuya APP and cloud services, and achieve interoperability with Power By Tuya devices.

At the same time, the tuyaopen will continuously expand, providing more cloud platform integration features, as well as voice, video, and facial recognition capabilities.

## Getting Start

### Prerequisites
Ubuntu and Debian

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install lcov cmake-curses-gui build-essential ninja-build wget git python3 python3-pip python3-venv libc6-i386 libsystemd-dev
```

> Note: After version v1.1.0, we adopted ninja as the build tool to speed up compilation. If you encounter compilation errors, please install ninja.

### Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/tuya/tuyaopen.git
```
The tuyeopen repository contains multiple submodules. The tos tool will check and automatically download the submodules before compilation, or you can manually download them using the command `git submodule update --init`.

## Setup and Compilation

### step1. Setting Environment Variables
```sh
$ cd tuyaopen
$ export PATH=$PATH:$PWD
```
Or add the tuyaopen path to your system environment variables.


tuyaopen can be compiled and debugged using the tos command, which will search for the tuyaopen repository based on the path set in the environment variables and execute the corresponding operations.

For detailed usage of the tos command, please refer to [tos command](./docs/en/tos_guide.md).

### step2. Select the corresponding example
Use the command `tos set_example` to complete the selection according to the platform, and the directory `examples` will be modified to the corresponding platform's examples.

### step3. Compilation
Select the corresponding project for the current compilation in examples or apps, and then run the following command to compile:
```sh
$ cd examples/get-started/sample_project
$ tos build
```
After compilation, the target files will be located in the `examples/get-started/sample_project/.build/t2/bin/t2_1.0.0` directory.

### Configuration 
To configure the selected examples or apps project, run the following command in the corresponding project directory for menu-driven configuration:
```sh
$ cd examples/get-started/sample_project
$ tos menuconfig
```
Configure the current project, save and exit after configuration, and then compile the project.

## Flashing

### GUI Tool Flashing
The `tyutool gui` flashing tool supports serial port flashing for multiple chips such as T2/T3/T5AI/BK7231N/LN882H/ESP32, and is compatible with Windows/Linux/macOS operating systems. Please choose the corresponding GUI flashing tool based on your operating system.
- Windows: [tyutool_win](https://images.tuyacn.com/smart/embed/package/vscode/data/ide_serial/win_tyutool_gui.tar.gz)
- Linux: [tyutool_linux.tar](https://images.tuyacn.com/smart/embed/package/vscode/data/ide_serial/tyutool_gui.tar.gz)
- macOS x86: [tyutool_mac_x86](https://images.tuyacn.com/smart/embed/package/vscode/data/ide_serial/darwin_x86_tyutool_gui.tar.gz)
- macOS arm64: [tyutool_mac_arm64.zip](https://images.tuyacn.com/smart/embed/package/vscode/data/ide_serial/darwin_arm64_tyutool_gui.tar.gz)

### Command Line Flashing
You can flash the device with a single command using `tos flash`.

1. In environments like Linux, you need to set the serial port permissions first using the following command; otherwise, an error will occur during execution.
```sh
$ sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
```

2. Run the `tos flash` command in the directory of the compiled project for one-click flashing. The `tos flash` command will automatically download the corresponding `tyutool` tool based on the current running environment and proceed with the flashing process.
```sh
$ cd examples/get-started/sample_project
$ tos flash

```

> Note: During the flashing process, you need to enter the boot mode according to the actual situation of the chip before performing serial port flashing.
> If there is no response from the serial port during the flashing process, please check whether the serial port is correctly selected or if it is being used by another program.

3. The `tos flash` flashing tool is continuously adding support for new chip models. Versions prior to v1.8.0 do not support automatic tool upgrades; subsequent versions will detect upgrades and prompt for an upgrade upon startup.
You can query the version information using `tos flash --version`,
```sh
$ tyutool params: --version
tyuTool, version 1.8.3
```

For versions prior to v1.8.0, you need to manually run the following command to upgrade:

```sh
$ tos flash upgrade
```
